# IBDP Computer Science Journal
Overview:
This repository contains my IB Diploma Programme (IBDP) Computer Science journal.


# Topic A: Concepts of computer science 
## Topic A.1: Computer fundementals 
1. Computer hardware and operations: CPU, GPU, difference between CPU and GPU, primary memory types, fetch decode and execute cycle, pipelinging in multi-core architecture (HL), compression, cloud computing
2. Data representation and computer logic: Representing data(number system), use of binary in storage of data(ASCII, purpose and use of logic gates, constructing and analysing truth tabbles, constructing logic diagrams 
3. Operating systems and control systems: role of OS, functions of OS(Memory management, file management, device management, sceduling, security, accounting, graphical user interface, Virtualization, Networking), approaches for scheduling(FCFC, Round robin, Priority scheduling, multilevel queue scheduling), inturrupt handling and polling(Inturrpts handling, polling, interrupts vs polling), role of os in multitasking and resource hadngling (task schedulinh, resource contention, deadlock, multasking challenges,) (HL). Use of OS components(Input, process, output and feedback mechanism, ) (HL), use of Control system in real life applications (home thermostat, automatic elvator control, autonomous vehicles, automatic washign machine, traffic signal control system, irrgiation control system, home-security system, automatic doors)(HL)
4. Translation: Translation processes of interpreters and compilers (interpreters, compliters, advanced compilers and interpreters, evaluation of different tranlation processes)
